Memorandum
谈路
To: Officer Welsh
From: Sergeant J Rodriguez
Subject: Letter of Reprimand
Date: 06-25-18
Officer Welsh,
On 06-04-18 at approximately 1645 hours, you were involved in an on-duty collision. At the time, you were traveling in vehicle #26, license plate number 61127D, a marked Ford Explorer.
The claim is while you were driving, you looked down to pick up the in car mobile radio and rear ended another vehicle.
1 conducted an investigation of the accident (see attached), and have come to the conclusion you were looking down reaching for the in car mobile radio and did not stop in time to avoid the collision. Further, it appears you looking down reaching for the in car mobile radio is likely the most significant cause of the collision.
There were four officers working handling nearly 50 calls that day. It was a busy, however, you surely understand that driving is one of the highest liability activities that we as police officers and city employees engage in every day. In this case, there were no serious injuries as a result of your collision. Your immediate attention was to see if the driver and passenger were ok. You immediately called for me to respond.
Through my investigation, I have found that you violated the following policies and laws:
RCW 46.61.145 Following too Close
Department Policy 318.5.10 (g) Any personal action contributing to a preventable traffic collision
Officer Welsh, your actions on 06-04-18 were a significant causing factor in an on-duty injury collision. In my conversations with you after the collision, you felt terrible about what happened, and will likely never make that mistake again, but I do need to inform you that discipline for this type of incident is progressive, and any further lapses in this area could lead to more serious discipline up to and including termination.
This letter will remain in your personnel file as outlined in section 9.06 of the MLPD Labor Agreement.
Sincerely.
Streant of tismois
