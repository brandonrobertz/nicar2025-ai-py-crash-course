On 10/25/2017 you were driving your assigned department owned vehicle while on duty. As you were backing out of the angled parking stall in front of the police department, you subsequently backed into privately owned farm vehicle parked next to your assigned department owned vehicle, resulting in damage to the patrol vehicle.
Department Policy #7.03.19 City Property states: "Members shall not lose or damage City Property.
Members are required to care for the items issued to them or in their control."
Policy #27.06.03 requires that a review be completed. I have reviewed the incident report and discussed this matter with you. While the totality of circumstances indicate that your vision was obstructed from clearly observing the farm truck in its entirety, additional measures could have been taken to avoid this collision and subsequent damage to department property. Based on this you are found to be at fault as that this was a preventable accident.
I have read and understand the above information and discussed this with my immediate supervisor.
Ofc.
I met with MPO Steve Gay on 10-25-17 and discussed with him the issue noted.
