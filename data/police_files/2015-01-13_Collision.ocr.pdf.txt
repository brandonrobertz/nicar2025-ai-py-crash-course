Notification of Disciplinary Action
Officer Clark. the intent of this communication is to formally notify you of disciplinary action being taken regarding an internal investigation and to serve as the documentation of same.
On December 26. 2014 Lt. P. Mize initiated an internal investigation as the result of an on-duty collision you were involved in on November 24, 2014. The conclusion of the investigation into this matter found that you had violated the following Department policies:
• Policy 1006.4
• Policy 1006.7
Vehicle Operations
Accident Damage, Abuse, and Misuse
The investigation packet was reviewed by Chief Stines and he found that the investigation was conducted within department policy. Additionally, he concurred with the recommended discipline: a formal letter of reprimand.
Officer Clark, while I believe there was no malicious intent in failing to report the collision you were involved in, the fact of the matter is there is also no legitimate excuse for your actions.
Your failure to report and/or document this collision has exposed the City to potential liability.
Be aware that any further violations of this manner, if founded, will be met with higher levels of discipline, up to and including termination.
