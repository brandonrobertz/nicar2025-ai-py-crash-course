RE: PUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST 20-22
Dear Brandon:
In an email dated July 16, 2020, you were advised that the City believed it would need until July 31, 2020, to locate
and review all of the documents requested by you. You were also advised that. if it is determined that additional time is required, you will be notified.
Attached is a record the City believes to be responsive to your request.
Per RCW 42.56.250(12) I am required to send a notice (I forwarded it to you on July 21 $) to the employee giving them at least 10 days to enjoin the release of the record if they wish to do so. Since it is an ex-employee, I also sent a letter. It I don't hear back from them, I will release the second (and final) record on August 7th.
The City believes it will need until August 7, 2020, to locate and review all of the documents requested by you.
Given the breadth of the requests made without limitation to time period, it is not certain at this time whether all of the documents requested can be retrieved within that timetrame. If it is determined that additional time is required, you will be notified.
Although we will specifically address the substance of each request, we do note in general terms that the Public Record Act allows members of the public to inspect and copy identifiable public records. It does not contain a provision allowing the general solicitation of information, nor does it require a public agency to "create" a public record that is responsive to a public records request. We mention this at the outset in case some of vour requests do not refer to identifiable public records.
Please contact me immediately it you have any questions
Sincerely
Samuel Crawford, MPA
City Clerk/Assistant to the City Manager
