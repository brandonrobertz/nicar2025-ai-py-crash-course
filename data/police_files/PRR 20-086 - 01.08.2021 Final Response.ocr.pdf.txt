RE: PRR No. 20-086 - Final Installment and Closure
Dear Mr. Roberts:
On June 15, 2020, the City of Pacific received your request for public records, requesting the following documents:
• Records of reprimands or warnings issued to officers of the Pacific Police Department between January 1, 2000 and
January 1, 2020
• Information being requested includes, but not limited to: officer name, date of reprimand warning, type of allegation/infraction (e.g. excessive use of force, unauthorized use of equipment, etc.), finding (e.g. sustained, unfounded), and action(s) taken (e.g. written or verbal warning, suspension).
On July 13, 2020, you revised your request to read: If reducing the time range would speed up the process, I will request to narrow my search to the past 10 years (since Jan 2010). Furthermore, I am interested only in infractions that resulted in punishment and am particularly interested in more serious violations that led to more serious punishments like suspension, termination, strikes against their record or resulted in the officer resigning.
The City has identified a final installment of responsive records attached with this letter. This installment includes five electronic files; the City will waive the fees associated with this installment in light of the re-opening of your request. With this installment, your request is now closed.
If you have any questions regarding this letter please feel free to contact the undersigned.
Regards,
Waite Cassell
Laurie Cassell
City Clerk
