On August 6, 2011 an internal investigation was initiated in reference to an allegation that you disclosed confidential information to a non-criminal justice individual and that your conduct involved sending a derogatory article to the parent of a juvenile you arrested. On October 14, 2011 a Loudermill hearing took place and I listened to the information you presented. After review of the investigation and careful consideration of the facts, I have concluded your actions violated:

A. 3 Unbecoming Conduct - At no time shall employees conduct themselves in a manner that may bring discredit upon the department or that may impair the effective operations of the department.

Redmond Police Department Manual of Standards (MOS) 13.1.1 B.29, Misuse of
Privileged Information
B. 29 Misuse of Privileged Information - Employees shall not use information gained through their employment for their personal benefit.
In addition to the above, Criminal Justice Information Sharing rules do not allow for the disclosure of criminal justice information to non-criminal justice entities.
Determination: Substantiated
Based on information revealed during this investigation and considering the information that you provided at our meeting on October 14, 2011, I have decided to impose a one day (10 hour) suspension without pay.
