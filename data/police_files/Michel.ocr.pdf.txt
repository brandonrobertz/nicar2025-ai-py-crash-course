Verbal Counseling Reference Ofc. Michel Accident
01/22/2018
This notice is in regard to the verbal counseling that occurred following Ofc. Michel's accident that occurred on 01/05/2018. Officer Michel had backed into a citizen's vehicle at 6th and Burden Blvd. (See attached accident report)
Ofc. Michel explained that he did not see the vehicle in his rear view mirrors as he was backing and that the backing sensors did not alert him to there being a vehicle behind him. There were no injuries and some damage to the citizen's front end of his car.
Ofc. Michel understands the importance of driving and operating a patrol vehicle while on duty. I believe this was an isolated incident and that discipline or remedial training is unnecessary for this incident.
Ofc. Michel is a valuable member to our organization and his service is appreciated. I know him to be a trustworthy employee and one willing to heed correction and make appropriate and reasonable changes when brought to his attention.
This memo serves to document the verbal counseling that had occurred with Ofc. Michel.
Future violations of this policy may result in more serious discipline, up to and including termination.
Sergeant James Thompson
