TO:
Officer Andrew Tavlor
DATE: 01/10/2020
FROM: Sergeant Rigo Pruneda
On 6/11/2019 Officer Taylor conducted a traffic stop of a reckless vehicle in the Wal Mart parking lot. He contacted the driver Antonio Martinez. Martinez then fled the scene and eluded Officer Taylor. Officer Taylor had the identification of the driver who fled.
Officer Taylor chose to pursue Martinez even though he knew the identity of the suspect.
41.2.2 VEHICLE PURSUITS
B. Decision to Pursue Officers must consider these factors before deciding whether or not to pursue: 1. The nature and seriousness of the initial offense compared to the hazard to the public created by the pursuit. 2. Decide if there is a need for immediate apprehension or can the suspect be identified and charged through investigation. 3. Other important considerations include: Traffic volume, roadway conditions, weather, familiarity with geography, the speed of the pursuit and the ability of other motorists and pedestrians to hear and see police emergency equipment.
The purpose of this reprimand is to ensure your modified behavior so there are no further incidents of this nature occur. Further violations of a similar incident may result in more severe discipline to include termination.
I hereby acknowledge receipt of the verbal warning
