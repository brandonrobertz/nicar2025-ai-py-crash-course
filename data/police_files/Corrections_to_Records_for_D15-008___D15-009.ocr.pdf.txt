Dennis,
It looks like D15-008 and D15-009 became improperly entangled back in 2015.
For D15-009, the letter provided By Dep. Preston does not appear to have been provided to Internal Affairs, or if it was, they clearly did not correct the disciplinary record. I have done so with D15-009, adding the following note to that file:
On May 2, 2016, Chief Chapman issued a letter exonerating Deputy Preston from any wrong doing in this matter. That letter has been added to the file, as of May 3, 2021 when it was discovered that the disciplinary record had not been properly corrected within the Internal Affairs system.
This record is corrected accordingly.
I have changed the case outcome to read "Exonerated" rather than "Sustained".

D15-008 was a use of force report submitted by Dep. Preston, and it should not have been coded as a disciplinary record at all. I have corrected the record for that file as well, changing it from a disciplinary records to a use of force, and correcting that case outcome
Both of these files have a copy of this email to assist in documenting the corrective action taken with each record.
