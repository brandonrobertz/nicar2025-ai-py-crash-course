435 BASISTA
On June 1, 2014 you backed your assigned patrol vehicle into a barrier at
15
in Ephrata, Washington. The vehicle sustained both mechanical and body damage. The mechanical cost was $623.54, the estimated body cost was $717.64, for a total damage cost of $1,341.18.
Your actions violated Ephrata Police Department Regulation 706.7 Accident damage, Abuse and Misuse, states in part; "An administrative investigation will be conducted to determine if there is any vehicle abuse or misuse. If it is determined that misuse or abuse was a result of negligent conduct or operation, appropriate disciplinary action will result. Based on the department disciplinary matrix the appropriate level of discipline for a first time violation of backing into a concrete barrier is a written reprimand.
You are to consider this a written reprimand. I hope you will use this in a constructive manner and in the future use due care and caution when operating a patrol vehicle.
