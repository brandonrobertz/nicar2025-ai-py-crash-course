On 12/09/2019 you informed me that while performing your weekly uniform cleaning at home, you unintentionally left your department issued cellular phone in one of the chest pockets on your ballistic vest
external carer and subsequentlv ran the carrier through a wash cycle in your clothes washer, subsequently destroying your issued cellular phone.
Department Policy 700.2 CARE OF Department PROPERTY
Employees shall be responsible for the safekeeping, serviceable condition, proper care, use and replacement of department property assigned or entrusted to them. An employee's intentional or negligent abuse or misuse of department property may lead to discipline including, but not limited to
the cost of repair or replacement.
While the totality of circumstances indicates that your actions which resulted in the destruction of the cellular telephone were unintentional, additional measures could have been taken to avoid the destruction of department property. Based on this you are found to be at fault as that this incident was preventable.
I have read and understand the above information and discussed this with my immediate supervisor.
Officer Giles
I met with Officer Giles on 12-10-19 and discussed with him the issue noted.
