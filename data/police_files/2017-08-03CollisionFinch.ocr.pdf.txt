Notification of Disciplinary Action
Officer Brent Finch, the intent of this communication is to formally notify you of disciplinary action being taken as a result of an on-duty collision you were involved in.
On June 19, 2017 an internal investigation was initiated after the Collision Review Board ruled the collision you were involved in on May 25, 2017th was avoidable and that you were in violation of Policy 402 - Officer Response to Calls and Policy 548 - Seatbelts. The results of the internal investigation conducted by Lieutenant Bruce Brenna also found you were in violation of both policies.
I completed my review of the internal investigation today and then met with Lt. Brenna. At the conclusion of our meeting the decision is to impose discipline in the form of a 1-year letter of reprimand.
Officer Finch, while I appreciate the ownership you have taken from the onset of this incident and wholeheartedly believe this was momentary lapse of attention, sometimes this is still insufficient to cover our actions. The fact of the matter is your failure to recognize the traffic signals at the intersection remained red for your direction of travel resulted in the total destruction of one police vehicle, likely total destruction to the citizen's vehicle and endangered the personal health and safety of you both. Your failure to wear your seatbelt further endangered yourself. My hope is you will use this as a learning lesson and continue on with advancing what has been a stellar career at TPD. However, be advised future violations of a similar nature, in accordance with Policy 324.5 - Progressive Discipline, could result in discipline ranging from suspension without pay to termination.
