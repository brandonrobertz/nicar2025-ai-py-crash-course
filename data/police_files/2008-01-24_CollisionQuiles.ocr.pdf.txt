RE:
Officer Involved Motor Vehicle Accident
Officer Quiles, the intent of this communication is to inform you of the results of the accident review board held November 5, 2007 and any discipline recommended by said review board.
On September 25, 2007 you were returning from SWAT training on the Centralia Alpha Rd. While turning a corner you lost control of your vehicle, striking a guardrail and rotating 360 degrees. This occurred as a result of a weapon, which had not been properly secured, coming out of it's rack and striking you while you were driving.
The accident review board examined the report submitted by the WSP and associated photos. It was determined that the accident was:
The accident was found to be avoidable. The board found that you were remiss in not properly securing your rifle which was the catalyst for your losing control of your patrol vehicle.
The accident review board recommended a three year letter of reprimand be placed in your file. I concur with this recommendation.
Officer Quiles, the general public counts on our officers to uphold the highest standards of safety and to be diligent in our duties. Your lack of attention to detail in this regard led to a patrol vehicle being totaled. The replacement cost which is in excess of $25,000 and repair to the guardrail which you damaged. Only luck kept the roadway clear so that another vehicle was not struck. Your last accident was in August of 2005; it was deemed that you were at fault in that accident as well. This is not consistent with our mission as a police agency and is not acceptable.
You are hereby notified that further incidents of this nature could result in increasing levels of discipline, up to and including termination.

Commander J Stines
