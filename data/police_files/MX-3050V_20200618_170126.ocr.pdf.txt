Re:
Records Request
Dear Mr. Roberts:
This is in response to your public records requests dated and received by the Ephrata Police Department June 15, 2020.
Pursuant to Chapter 42.56 RCW, you have requested the following records:
Records of reprimands or warnings issued to officers of the Ephrata Police Department between January 1, 2000 and January 1, 2020 - Information being requested includes, but is not limited to: officer name, date of reprimand/warning, type of allegation/infraction (e.g. excessive use of force, unauthorized use of equipment, etc.), finding (e.g. sustained, unfounded), and actions) taken (e.g. written or verbal warning, suspension)
Because of the size and breadth of your request and the limited resources of the Police Department and Police staff, I estimate that it will take approximately 30 days to locate, review, assemble and copy the requested documents. These records will be released on or before July 15, 2020.
If you have any questions about this letter or your request, please contact me at (509) 754-2491.
Sincerely,
Erick Koch
Chief of Police
Elizabeth Kallstrom
Records Manager
