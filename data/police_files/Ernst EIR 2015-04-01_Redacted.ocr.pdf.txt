Re: Administrative Leave
Dear Officer Ernst,
I have decided to place you on paid administrative leave until such time as you are cleared to return to full police duty by a clinical psychologist of the City's choice.
This is purely a precautionary requirement with the best interests of your health and wellbeing as a primary concern. We will attempt to schedule an evaluation as soon as possible.
Upon receipt of this letter, the police department will take possession of all firearms issued to you by this police department. These firearms will be returned to you upon your clearance to return to full duty.
You are still an employee of this police department and are required to report to scheduled court appearances, and any meetings that have been scheduled requiring your attendance.
I look forward to your full return to duty.
Sincerely,
/211
- C. mate
Geoffrey C Marti
Chief of Police
