Re: Internal Investigation
Sergeant Holden,
I have read the final report submitted by the Human Relations Officer for the City Port Orchard regarding the administrative investigation initiated March 26*, 2013.
Allegations of violations of General Orders 1420. 12; 1420.29d; and 1420.37 are not sustained
Allegations of violations of General Orders 1040; 1420.21 and 1420.29 are sustained.
I am not considering demotion, suspension, or your discharge from employment from the police department. Therefore I am not scheduling a pre-disciplinary hearing
I am ordering you to work with Police Commander Dale Schuster to schedule a time to meet and receive discipline for the sustained violations. You may also make arrangements with Human Relations Director Deb Howard to review her documentation of this investigation
Please feel free to contact my office should you have any questions.
Sincerely,
Geoffrey C Marti
Chief of Police
