SUBJECT: Coaching & Counseling
DATE: 10/29/2019
On 9-10-2019 I spoke with Officer Jeremy Jones about the importance of having a regular routine when handling property during search incident to arrest. Officer Jones stated he has a regular routine but deviated from it in this incident, resulting in the loss of the suspects' property. He added that he would learn from this experience and be diligent in guarding property under his control, in the future.
Officer Jones was accepting of the coaching and was quite critical of his loss of the property. I do not expect this will be a problem in the future.
