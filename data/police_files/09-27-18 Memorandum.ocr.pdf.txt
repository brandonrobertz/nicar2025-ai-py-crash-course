General Conduct on Duty, Chapter 3; Section 3.08 - Assignments and Reporting Employees shall promptly carry out department business, and promptly and truthfully submit such reports (in a timely manner) as are required in performance of their duties.
A verbal reprimand was determined to be the appropriate discipline for this violation. Officer Anderson was given direct orders on July 20, August 30 and September 23, 2018 to complete and submit case 2017-1139 assigned to Officer Anderson in April 2017.

This memo will serve as written documentation that Officer Anderson was verbally counselled regarding the importance of submitting the initial case report in a prompt and timely manner as required in performance of his duties. Officer Anderson will receive counseling and training on submitting initial case reports promptly and submitting supplemental follow up reports as needed for a case

This memo is not part of Officer Anderson personnel file and will be retained for documentation purposes only until the written documentation is purged according to current records retention policy. A copy of this memo was given to Officer Anderson.
