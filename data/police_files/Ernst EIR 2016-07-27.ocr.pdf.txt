Date of Incident: 7/27/2016 Time: 1103 Location: Bethel Rd. SE/SE Van Skiver Rd.
Violation of General Order/Other: G.0.1810 II.K.4.b and G.0.1830 II.D.1.
NARRATIVE: Officer Ernst found a vehicle that Kitsap County Deputies had pursued earlier for reckless driving and he got into a pursuit with the same vehicle. This same vehicle ended up being an unconfirmed stolen out of a different law enforcement agency. During the pursuit Officer Ernst's patrol vehicle collided with a citizen's vehicle. A brake inspection done by WSP and the City of Port Orchard mechanic didn't show any signs of abnormalities.
WSP's conclusion was "brake fade" to the point where the brakes heated up and they lost the ability to effectively slow or stop the patrol vehicle. I listened to the CENCOM audio recording. During the recorded portions of the pursuit, when Officer Ernst spoke on his radio, I didn't hear a siren. This was a Maior Preventable Accident.
