COUNSELING NOTICE
On Saturday, 1/21/2007, you were on duty, driving patrol car 05-102. At 1918 hours you were westbound on Court Street when you observed a traffic violation by an eastbound car. You activated your overhead emergency lights and made a U-turn in the 1800 block of W. Court Street. You observed other eastbound vehicles begin to slow for you and then looked back to see the location of the violator, as you began your turn. When vou again looked forward, there was an eastbound Dodge Caravan in the curb lane that you were unable to avoid and collided with it.
The Dodge Caravan was occupied by 3 people and neither they nor you were injured.
The Caravan had minor damage to the left front and was drivable. The patrol car had minor damage to it's right front and was drivable, but was deadlined until it could be inspected for front end alignment and receive body damage repair.
The accident investigation determined that even though you had activated your emergency lights prior to making the U-turn, you were the "at fault driver." While making your turn you were looking for the violator instead of watching the front end of your patrol car. You failed to make sure that eastbound traffic had in fact yielded for you before entering into the U-turn.
Pasco Police Department Policy 41.2.1.B says that we are to "drive in a safe manner and operate the vehicle in compliance with the R.C.W.'s." RCW 46.61.035 says that a driver of an emergency vehicle must still "drive with due regard for the safety of all persons.".
RCW 46.61.295 says that a U-turn can't be made "unless such movement can be made in safety."
The purpose of this counseling notice is to remind you of your duty to always drive in a safe manner. Any future patrol vehicle accidents may result in more severe discipline.
I hereby acknowledge receipt of this Counseling Notice
