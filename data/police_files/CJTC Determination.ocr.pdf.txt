RE: Joshua K.I. Lewis
Dear Chief Gibson,
On February 23, 2016, I received the investigative file in reference to the Notice of Separation form for Joshua K.I. Lewis. On that form, you indicated Mr. Lewis resigned in anticipation of termination and the agency was aware of conduct that may constitute "disqualifying misconduct" as defined by RCW 43.101.010 (8) or (9).
The Commission must be able to prove by clear, cogent and convincing evidence that the circumstances leading to Mr. Lewis' resignation involved disqualifying misconduct as defined under RCW 43.101.010
(8). After reviewing the file, I have found there is insufficient evidence to meet this burden of proof.
Therefore, I am declining to initiate action to revoke Mr. Lewis' Washington State peace officer certification.
If you disagree with this decision and would like to have it reviewed, WAC 139-06-040(2) allows the opportunity for review of this decision by the Chair of the Commission. Such a request for review must be made in writing within fourteen days of the mailing of this notification. The written request for review must be accompanied by a copy of this notice and mailed to:
Chief Jeff Myers, Commission Chair Hoquiam Police Department
215 10th Street
Hoquiam, WA 98550
If a request for review is not received within fourteen days, the WSCJTC will destroy its copy of the investigative files as required by RCW 43.101.400 (4).
Sincerely,
Tisha Jones
Peace Officer Certification Manager
