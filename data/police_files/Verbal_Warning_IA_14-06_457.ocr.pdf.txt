On May 30, 2014, an investigation of possible policy violation(s) leading up to and including a motor vehicle accident on May 28, 2014, was commenced. On July 3, 2014, I notified you of my intent to discipline with a written reprimand. On July 17, 2014, I held a pre-disciplinary hearing to give you the opportunity to provide additional evidence or mitigating circumstances related to the investigation as it pertains to the intended discipline. Pullman Police Officers' Guild (PPOG) representative Wade Winegardner was present, and PPOG attorney Anil Karia, was on speakerphone, both at your request.
As a result of the information presented during the pre-disciplinary hearing, I have amended the intended discipline to a verbal warning for violation of Pullman Police Department Policy, Chapter 9, Section 2.2.
