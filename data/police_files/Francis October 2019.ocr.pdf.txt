Captain Sands,
On 10-05-19, Officer Francis and Officer Pitt responded to Walmart, 1005 N Stratford Rd, in regards to a theft where the suspect was in possession of a knife (19ML13992). Officers Francis and Pitt used appropriate force to subdue the subject, but it was the conduct and treatment of the suspect that violated policy by Officer Francis.
On 12-29-19 at 1800 hours, I met with Officer Francis to obtain a recorded statement. We began with watching the video and then asked Officer Francis if he could explain his conduct. I reminded Officer Francis the use of force was justified, but it were the comments made to the suspect that were unacceptable.
Officer Francis stated the language he used was not said with malice. It was said to "be real" with the subject. Officer Francis stated if it was done with malice he could see that it was wrong.
I explained the importance of being able to be in a high stress situation to bring it back down, de-escalation, once things are controlled. In this case, Officer Francis did not and continued belittling and disrespecting the suspect.
Officer Francis violated policy 318.5.9 (t) (g). Officer Francis' actions in this case were unacceptable and the Core Values were called into question because of his actions.
I am forwarding this letter for further disciplinary actions, if any, and this letter will stay in Officer Francis' file for two years, under our current labor agreement section 9.06.
Officer Francis' conduct and behavior in this instance is unacceptable and any further violation will result in progressive discipline up to and including termination.
Sincerely,
Moses Lake Police Department 411 S Balsam Ave, Moses Lake, WA 98837 (509)764-3887
Professionalism, Integrity, Compassion, Service
