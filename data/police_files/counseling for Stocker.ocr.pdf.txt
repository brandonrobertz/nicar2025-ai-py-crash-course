Dave,
I sat down with Andy this morning and advised him of the counseling on the two issues that I briefed him on concerning Comenout and the medicine issue. He stated that he was responsible for the Comenout issue, but that the facts concerning the medications were not accurate. He explained that the wife did not bring the medications to the PD until the night before he had the stroke. He stated that he did not get them until the evening and then it was to late to give them to him. He filled out the medical paperwork. The meds were to be taken once daily. The subject was supposed to get out of our jail in the morning.
His account of what happened differed significantly from what you had briefed me. I advised him to write down his side of what happened for your review. He stated that he would get that done tonight and forward it.
At this time, I didn't issue him any counseling on the medical issue until the facts are reviewed.
