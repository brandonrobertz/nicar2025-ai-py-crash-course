FORMAL REPRIMAND
On April 11, 2008 at 0845 hours, you were driving in the south parking lot of the Village at Chapel Hills looking for a vehicle belonging to a wanted subject. At that time a dump truck was also driving in the same parking lot. You, operating marked patrol vehicle numbered 111, backed into a carport parking slot, numbered 150, to let the truck through. When you did this you struck the carport pole with the right rear portion of the patrol vehicle. Although there was no damage to the carport, the patrol vehicle sustained almost $ 700.00 dollars in damage.
Your failure to safely operate your patrol vehicle violates Department Policy numbered
41.2.1 (B) to wit:
B. Responsibilities of On-Duty Driving
When officers are not responding to calls, they are expected to drive in a safe manner and operate the vehicle in compliance with the R.C.W.'s.
Nothing in this section is meant to reduce officer's responsibilities as outlined in RCW
46.61.035 "Authorized Emergency Vehicles."
Your unsafe operation of a patrol vehicle and two previous at fault accidents, on March 18, 2007 and September 4, 2007, have resulted in this written reprimand. The purpose of this reprimand is to ensure you modify your patrol vehicle operations so there are no more incidents of this nature in the future. Further violations similar in nature may result in more severe discipline to include termination.
1 hereby acknowledge receipt of the reprimand
