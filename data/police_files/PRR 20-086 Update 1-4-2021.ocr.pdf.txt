RE: Public Records Request No. 2020-086 Update on Request
Dear Mr. Roberts:
On June 15, 2020, the City received your request for public records, seeking the following:
Records of reprimands or warnings issued to officers of the Pacific Police Department between January 1, 2000 and January
1, 2020
Information being requested includes, but not limited to: officer name, date of reprimand warning, type of allegation/infraction (e.g. excessive use of force, unauthorized use of equipment, etc.), finding (e.g. sustained, unfounded), and action(s) taken (e.g. written or verbal warning, suspension).
On July 13, 2020, you revised your request to read: If reducing the time range would speed up the process, I will request to narrow my search to the past 10 years (since Jan 2010). Furthermore, I am interested only in infractions that resulted in punishment and am particularly interested in more serious violations that led to more serious punishments like suspension, termination, strikes against their record or resulted in the officer resigning.
By September 29, 2020, the City had provided you with the responsive records located in its search and you were issued a notice that your request had been administratively closed. The City recently located additional records responsive to your request. Accordingly, the City is re-opening your request to provide you with those records
The City continues to process this request, and now anticipates the next installment for your request will be ready for your retrieval on or before January 13, 2021.
If you have any questions regarding this request, please contact the undersigned.
Regards,
Mathie Casset
Laurie Cassell
City Clerk
