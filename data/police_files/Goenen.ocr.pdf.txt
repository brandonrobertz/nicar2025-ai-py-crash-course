Written Counseling Notice
November 13, 2014
Officer Goenen,
On October 14, 2014 you had an altercation with Officer Brewster at 1749 N. 22nd. The facts I know are this:
You assisted Officer Brewster in the incident at this address. After a person, Lilton Green was placed in a patrol car in front of this residence; you and Officer Brewster had a heated discussion about the incident. At one point you went back to your car and slammed the door shut. It was apparent to everyone that you were upset including the person you had in the back of the patrol car, Lilton Green. Two officers at the scene described your behavior as out of line and not in keeping with the standards of a Pasco Police Officer.
This is a violation of Pasco Police Policy 26.1.1, N, Conduct toward Fellow Employees.
This is your notice that you are being giving a written counseling letter for your conduct.
A copy of this will be retained in your file as proscribed by contract and policy.
Again, this is a counseling notice. We have discussed the issue at hand and other ways to have handled those issues.
