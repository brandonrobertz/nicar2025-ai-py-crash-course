FORMAL REPRIMAND
On July 3, 2014 you were the supervisor working patrol. You had investigated a possible burglary which you believed two officers had failed to properly investigate a few days before. You opted to make disparaging comments to both officers in the presence of other members of the department.
Frustrated as you may have been, your negative comments were not intended to correct any deficiencies by the officers and were simply made in a manner that drew attention to their potential poor work and embarrass them in front of their peers.
At no time is it acceptable for any member of this department to speak negatively about another employee simply to embarrass them. As a supervisor you are certainly not in a position to ridicule employees and should always be looking at ways to correct employee's actions in a positive manner.
After an investigation was completed it was found that you violated the following department policies:
26. 1. 1 Code of Conduct
Unbecoming Conduct: Employees of the Police Department shall conduct
Themselves at all times, both on and off duty, in a manner that does not reflect Negatively on the Department. Employee conduct, which brings discredit on the Department, may subject the employee to discipline.
N. Conduct Toward Fellow Employees: Employees, while on duty, will treat all personnel with respect and courtesy.
PPP. Derogatory Remarks: No members or employees of the department shall directly or indirectly speak critically or derogatory to, or about, other members and employees of the department...
The purpose of this reprimand and subsequent day suspension is to ensure your modified behavior so there are no more incidents of this nature occur. Further violations of a similar incident may result in more severe discipline
