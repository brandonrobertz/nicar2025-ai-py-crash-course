Reference: Letter of Reprimand
Officer Carter,
On September 30* you responded to a deputy requesting help. During your response you failed to negotiate a curve in the roadway in the 800 block of E. Third due to the speed you were driving. As a result you ran the patrol car into the curb causing between $3000-5000 in damage. Ultimately your actions prevented you from responding to help a fellow officer requesting assistance, and took a much needed patrol vehicle out of service.
Officer Carter I am sure your Field Training Officer discussed with you the maxim that you cannot help anyone if you don't get there safely. I am also sure your FTO discussed the need to safely operate not only your vehicle, but any equipment entrusted to you by the agency. Please take both of those lessons to heart
While I know your actions on September 30th were not intentional, they are violations of MLPD Policy 318.5.10
MLPD Civil Service rule X 2.A, and our Core Value of Service. Therefore, I am issuing you this disciplinary Letter of Reprimand. This letter will be placed in your personnel file and will remain there for two years. Any further violations of the referenced rules will subject you to progressive discipline in accordance with the Civil Service rules, policies, and collective bargaining agreements for/with the City of Moses Lake. The fact that this letter is coming from a Captain is due solely to your supervisor being off for a significant amount of time. This letter is no more severe than a letter issued by a Sergeant.
Officer Carter any discipline is about changing behavior, learning, and ultimately about making us better.
