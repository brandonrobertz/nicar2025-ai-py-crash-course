INTEROFFICE COMMUNICATION
REDMOND POLICE DEPARTMENT
TO:
Lt. Marty Fuller
FROM: Jackie Naroski, Property & Evidence Technician
SUBJECT: Statement of Observations in RPD parking Garage - Case 18-004808
DATE: September 14, 2018
On Tuesday, September 5, 2018 between the time of 0800 and 0825, I went downstairs into the Redmond PD parking garage to take an inventory of the vehicles in the evidence vehicle pens. I walked to each pen, noted the case number, type of car and officer associated with the vehicle per the zip tie on each pen. I did not notice anything out of the ordinary, as each pen was sealed with a zip tie and closed completely. I then went upstairs and inventoried the vehicles into Spillman. The Kia associated with the case was inventoried at 0825.
Between the hours of 0930 and 1000, Property and Evidence Technician, Sandra Gonzales and I went downstairs into the Redmond PD garage to review the current vehicles inventoried. As we approached vehicle pen #2, I noticed the latch on the gate was pushed in, leaving a gap of approximately 4-5 inches. The zip tie was still intact but was pushed up into the slot, allowing the metal pole that originally sat in the garage floor to be raised. This allowed the gate to be pushed open, thus allowing the gap in space. I commented to Sandra Gonzalez that the gate was not in this position when I came down at approximately 0800. We both decided not to touch the gate or the original officer's sealed zip tie, but rather re-seal the gate using additional zip ties to secure the opening.
The above statement is accurate to the best of my knowledge.
End of statement.
