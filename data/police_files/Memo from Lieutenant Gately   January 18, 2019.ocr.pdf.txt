The following statement is respectfully submitted at the request of Captain Erik Scarpon. In February 2018, I became assigned as the Investigation Division Commanding Officer, with the responsibility of supervising ProAct Unit Sergeant Matt Peringer.
During a command staff meeting in November 2018, Chief Kristi Wilson reported that Sgt.
Peringer may have received information from the King County Prosecutors Office expressing concern and/or prosecutorial challenges related to the fact Detective Sam Hovenden is on their
"Brady List."
I do not recall becoming informed of this information by Sgt. Peringer or any other party, prior to learning about it in command staff meetings), immediately prior to Sgt. Peringer being placed on administrative leave relevant to 18lA-010 on November 28, 2018.
