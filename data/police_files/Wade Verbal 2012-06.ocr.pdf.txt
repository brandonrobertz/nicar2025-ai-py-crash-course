Subiect: VERBAL WARNING
Officer Wade,
On 05 June 12, I discovered that you have been approving collision reports in SECTOR since being reassigned to patrolmen. You were not given permission by me to approve any such reports. Additional one of these reports you approved had no narrative attached to it and was rejected by Washington State Patrol.
You will also remove yourself from approving authority in the SECTOR system until
further notice
As an officer with over 13 years experience with the Eatonville Police Department you are extremly familiar with who and who does not approve reports. This is a violation of Eatonville Police Department Policy Number 03.03(2) and (10). This type of behavior will not be tolerated and future violations will result in progressive discipline.
This verbal warning will be placed in you personnel file. You have the right to place a written response to this warning in your filc.
