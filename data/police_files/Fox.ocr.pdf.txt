Ofc. Fox Verbal Counseling

Captain Harpster,
1 had the opportunity to speak with Ofc. Fox today regarding his accident in patrol car #213 on
01/10/2015. In this accident, Ofc. Fox struck a curb while making a u-turn and damaged the wheel and the tire on the passenger side
Ofc. Fox has never had an accident in a city vehicle prior to this incident and there were no records of any in his personnel file.
As Ofc. Fox is an EVOC Instructor, he was well aware of the error he had made and advised that he would do his best to insure that this never happens again.
I believe that this was an avoidable accident, but do not feel that Ofc. Fox requires any further discipline or counseling on the matter.
scle
Set. James Thompson
