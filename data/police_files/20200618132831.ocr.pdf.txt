Subject: Citizens Complaint
On 2-15-07 a couple that runs repossession business came to the Pd to complain about an officer. They could not provide the officers name but advised it was whoever was on around 0200 hours (Ofc. Roberts).
They advised that they were doing surveillance on the Stonehenge as the bartender had a vehicle in his possession that they needed to take possession of. The vehicle was not at the location and they were going to follow the subject to his residence and see if the vehicle was there.
The officer came up and asked what they were doing and he informed them that the vehicle was not there.
The officer stated that he wanted to watch the bar and that he needed to park there and told them to move.
Around 0230 hours the officer showed up at the bar and was talking to people out front. The persons working in the bar started to come out like they were leaving (waitresses with purses on shoulder), stopped and talked with the officer and then went back inside the bar. The couple waited until 0300 hours and the officer was still talking outside when they approached him and asked how long the workers would be in there. He told them it could be another two hours that they were cleaning up. The couple believed the officer told the bartender they were watching him and that was why he was not leaving. The officer stated that he knew the bartender and gave them direction to North Chestnut in Toppenish but could not
remember the number exactly.
The couple thought it was unethical for an officer to do this kind of behavior. They advised the bartender by not paying for the vehicle was a thief and felt that the officer tipped the persons off in the bar. They did not want to complete a complaint form but wanted the officer talked with as they felt it was not right.
