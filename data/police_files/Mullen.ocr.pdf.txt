MEMORANDUM
TO:
FROM:
Off. Joseph Mullen
Bob Metzger, Police Chief (sh),
RE:
Patrol Car Collision, 3/19/2016
DATE:
June 13, 2016
I received this information on June 10, 2016. I thoroughly reviewed the memo from Captain Harpster and the other information contained along with the memo. I agree with the conclusion that was reached by Captain Harpster. I also agree with the recommended discipline for this occurrence.
You are therefore assessed a 2 day suspension without pay for this collision. Based on your willingness to accept responsibility for this and your inexperience as an officer I am going to hold one day of this suspension in abeyance for a period of one year. If you do not get into any further collisions in this time period this one day will be suspended. You are to work with Captain Harpster on when the day will be taken. This incident will remain in your personnel file per the collective bargaining agreement. It is my hope that this is the only incident of this type that you will be involved in.
If you have any questions or would like to speak to me further about this please let me know.
