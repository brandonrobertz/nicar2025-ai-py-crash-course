By your own admission, you did not activate your emergency lights before attempting the U-turn, you did not see the vehicle in the inside lane approaching which caused you to side swipe the citizen's vehicle. Fortunately there were no injuries, but the attempted U-turn was unsafe and unnecessary considering the call type you were responding to. I appreciate and respect the fact that you took immediate ownership of the accident, which was investigated by WSP.
