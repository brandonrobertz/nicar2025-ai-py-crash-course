On November 27, 2018, I received information that you possibly viewed a Moscow Police report in Spillman without a legitimate law enforcement purpose. An internal investigation was initiated and assigned to Commander Chris Tenant.
Commander Tenant conducted a full investigation to determine if you violated Pullman Police Department (PPD) or City policies. Commander Tenant forwarded the completed investigation to me with his conclusions and recommendations.
The investigation revealed that you admitted viewing a Moscow Police report without any nexus to a Pullman Police investigation. This is also supported by the available evidence. Consequently, the allegation is "sustained". This is a violation of the following PPD Policy (provided, in part, as follows):
Chapter 13, Section 2.9: Police Department Member Access to Police Department Records. Members of the police department are granted access to only those records necessary for and directly related to the performance of their duties (need to know).
However, although a technical policy violation did occur, discipline is not called for
in this instance due to the mitigating circumstances. I do caution that future policy violations of a similar nature could result in disciplinary action.
