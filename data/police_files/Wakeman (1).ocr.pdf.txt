MEMORANDUM
Officer Jeremy Wakeman
Bob Metzger, Police Chief Traffic Crash, 5-30-18
July 5, 2018
On Thursday, July 5, 2018, a pre-disciplinary hearing was held. Present for this was the following:
Officer Wakeman, Officer A. Wright, Sergeant Gregory. Officer Wakeman was asked if he had anything further to address regarding this crash. He added that he had just spent 3 hours with a person well known to the department, Nancy Pulliam. He indicated that he felt the need to hurry up and finish this call up so that he could get back to taking calls in his area. Otherwise Officer Wakeman did not disagree with what happened, though he does have memory loss from the collision.
I have taken this information into account in making a final determination. Based on my review of this incident, your information from the hearing and your past record I have decided on the following: a three (3) day suspension. Two (2) of the three days will be held in abeyance for one year. If no further violations occur for this one year period, the discipline will be reduced to a one day suspension. Any additional violations that occur during the one year will result in the three day suspension being imposed. In addition to this reprimand you will be suspended as an EVOC instructor for one year.
This reprimand will be placed in your personnel file. If you have any questions or need further information please let me know.
Respectfully,
Robie
Robert Metzger
Chief of Police
