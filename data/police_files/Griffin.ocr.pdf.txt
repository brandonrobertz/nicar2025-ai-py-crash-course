LETTER OF REPRIMAND
To:
FROM:
DATE:
OFFICER JASON GRIFFIN
SERGEANT DAVID ALLEN
011609
You recently returned a "loaner" MDC to Jesse Rice of Information Services. You then emailed Rice, asking him to return the DVD movie "Gladiator" back to you, because you had left it in the DVD drive of the MDC. The MDC was checked, and "Gladiator" was found in the drive.
This creates the clear presumption that you were watching movies while on-duty, using the MDC supplied for work purposes. This is a clear violation of both Policy 41.3.7, which states that the MDC and software are to be used only for work-related purposes, and of basic work ethic, which says that you should be working while you are on-duty.
Your DVD has been returned to you, and we have discussed that watching a movie on the MDC will cause your patrol car to be parked and your attention distracted for the length of the viewing, and would give the public a very poor image of our law enforcement efforts if anyone was to approach you while it was occurring. You have been directed not to do it again.
This Letter of Reprimand will remain in your permanent employee file. It will be referred to on your next annual evaluation. It will also form the basis for more serious discipline if you should violate policy in a
similar manner in the tuture.
