Counseling Notice
In February-2000 you made comments to an employee of Hanford Collectors concerning others employed by Hanford Collectors. During your conversation with this employee you made comment that were negative towards the other employees of Hanford Collectors. You were confronted several days later by some of the questionable employees. These employees threaten to run credit history check on you. In response you made comments that were less then professional.
Instead of making these comments it would have been more appropriate to speak with the owner of Hanford Collectors about your concerns or your immediate supervisor. On both occasions you should have refrained from making any negative comments.
In the future you are to refrain from making comments that are not in the best interest of the department. Professionalism is of the most importance and a necessity as a member of the Pasco Police Department.
This counseling notice will not be a part of you personnel file. Any future incidents will be subject to more severe discipline.
