FORMAL REPRIMAND
On January 26th 2010 you were involved in a at fault vehicle collision at 20th and Pearl Street. When asked by myself regarding the incident and weather you wished the accident review board look into the collision, you took responsibility for the collision stating that you believed the lane was clear when you began your U turn movement.
Once you recognized that the lane was not clear you stopped. The vehicle traveling in your direction did attempt to stop but was not able to and struck your patrol car. This occurred while you were responding to an in progress call. A check of your accident history found no prior collisions.
This reprimand is issued to you for violation of Department Policy 41.2.1.A to wit:
41.2.1.A
2. An urgent call is a more serious call where the safety of the public or apprehension of a suspect is affected by police response time. Officers are required to maintain safe vehicle operations and at a minimum, use overhead emergency lights. Use of the siren is optional, but recommended when clearing intersections. Examples of urgent calls are: robberies or burglaries just occurred.
Failure to properly clear the travel lane prior to making the turn resulted in the collision.
Failure to utilize visual signals and or audible signals which may have given additional warning to others and may possibly assisted in prevented this collision.
I hereby acknowledge receipt of this reprimand
