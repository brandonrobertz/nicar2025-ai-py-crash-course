Reference: Conditions for return to duty
Officer Taylor,
On September 17th you had a crisis situation requiring you being placed on Administrative leave. While on leave we had discussions regarding conditions that would be placed in order for you to return to duty. On October 10th, you and I met in my office where I issued a verbal order regarding the conditions for you to return to duty the following day. We discussed at that time there may be additional conditions set forth. This letter is to inform you of all the conditions we believe are important for your successful return to duty.
1. You will not have your personal cell phone, or any other personally owned mode of communication such as smart watch or other wearable technology, with you on duty. If your wife, or other family member, has an emergency they may call you on your work issued phone.
2. You will not allow your wife to monitor your location while at work.
3. You will take your contracted break times as calls allow with your shift mates.
4. You are reminded you took an oath to not talk about confidential information. This oath to keep confidential information to yourself extends to your wife or other family members. There is a reason it is called confidential.
5. For the next six months you will check in with your supervisor on a weekly basis. This will be done in person and in private.
The above conditions are meant to facilitate success for you at work as well as to ensure your safety. Constantly being distracted while working as a police officer is unacceptable for the risks it poses to you and to your shift
Odrtners
We value you as an employee Todd and we have taken a number of steps to assist you through this difficult time because of your value. However, violation of the above conditions will be cause for disciplinary action, up to and including termination
