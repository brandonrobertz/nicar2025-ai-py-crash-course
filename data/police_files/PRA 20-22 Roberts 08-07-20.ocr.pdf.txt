RE: PUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST 20-22
Dear Brandon:
In an email dated July 31, 2020, you were advised that the City believed it would need until August 7, 2020, to
locale and review all or the documents requested by you. You were also advised that. if it is determined that additional time is required, you will be notified.
Altached is a record the City believes to be responsive to your request. This is the final record for this request. The
City now considers this request complete.
Although we will specifically address the substance of each request, we do note in general terms that the Public Record Act allows members of the public to inspect and copy identifiable public records. It does not contain a provision allowing the general solicitation of information, nor does it require a public agency to "create" a public record that is responsive to a public records request. we mention this at the outset in case some of your requests do not refer to identifiable public records.
Please contact me immediately if you have any questions.
sincerely,
Samuel Crawford, MPA
City Clerk/Assistant to the City Manager
