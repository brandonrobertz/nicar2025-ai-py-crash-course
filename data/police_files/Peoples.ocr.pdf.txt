This memo is being written at the direction of Set. Vaught.
On 01/02/2017 at approximately 0700 hours while preparing for work and cycling my conductive electrical weapon, (Taser device,) I failed to remove the cartridge prior to activating the trigger. This caused the cartridge to fire prongs into the tile floor which was not damaged. Notification was made on the same morning to Sgt. Vaught.
Sergeant Vaught conducted remedial training on the same date.
Sincerely, de
Officer Kierra Peoples
