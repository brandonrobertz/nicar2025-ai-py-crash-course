REPRIMAND
TO:
FROM:
Det. Joshua Glass
Det. Sgt. Scott Warren
DATE: 02/04/2020
On 01/31/2020 at approximately 1715 hours, while operating your assigned patrol vehicle, 21192, you collided with Sgt. Vaught's patrol vehicle. He was in front of you but had stopped. You glanced down at your MDT to send a link to another officer about the call you both were going to. When you looked back up you realized that Sgt. Vaught had stopped. You attempted to stop your car but was not able to. Damage was minimal to his vehicle but yours was substantial enough to deadline it.
My investigation has determined that you were the at fault driver in this collision.
On 07/13/2018 you had another parking lot collision where you were the at fault driver.
