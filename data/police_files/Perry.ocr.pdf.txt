MEMORANDUM
TO:
Officer Dean Perry
FROM:
Bob Metzger, Police Chief
RE:
IA 2013-08
DATE:
December 19, 2013
On December 16, 2013, at 10:30am a hearing was held at the Pasco Police Department regarding this internal investigation. Present for this were the following, you, Mr. Patrick Emmal, Captain Raymond and me.
There were two allegations that had been made of you that were outlined in the December 11, 2013
notice of hearing memo that was given to you. You were asked in each allegation if it was true or not and if you had anything further to add to what you had told the investigators regarding these allegations. To each allegation, you indicated that you did not deny the charges.
You were asked if there were any mitigating factors that should be considered in the final findings in this incident. You told me that you were not aware of Sgt. Fairley's affairs or his sending of pictures to dispatchers. Had you been aware of these the meetings would not have occurred
In reviewing all of this information I make the following findings. You did participate in harassment in violation of Policy 26.1.3A. In addition, you did participate in gossip or derogatory remarks in violation of Policy 26.1.1 PPP.
Based on the information contained within this investigation and the above information it is my determination that you should receive discipline for these infractions. Taking into account what you told me at the hearing I am giving you a 1 day suspension. Since this is the holiday season I will not implement this until after the first of the year. I will work with your sergeant on when this suspension can be taken so that it does not adversely impact your shift.
Any appeal rights you may have regarding this decision are set forth in the applicable collective bargaining agreement.
