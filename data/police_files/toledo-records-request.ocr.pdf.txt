Dear Officer for Public Records:
This is a records request pursuant to the Washington State Public Records Act (RCW 42.56), which guarantees the public's access to information in the custody of governmental agencies. I respectfully request copies of the following information:
• Records of reprimands or warnings issued to officers of the Toledo Police Department between January 1, 2000 and January 1, 2020
• Information being requested includes, but is not limited to: officer name, date of reprimand/warning, type of allegation/infraction (e.g. excessive use of force, unauthorized use of equipment, etc.), finding (e.g. sustained, unfounded), and action(s) taken (e.g. written or verbal warning, suspension).
I prefer to receive copies of these records via e-mail
(openrecords.bxroberts@gmail.com) in a machine-readable format (Excel/ Word documents, text files, database dump, PDF, etc.).
If these records exist in electronic form, I request that you do not create a new record for me (e.g. by printing your electronic record and then scanning it), but provide the electronic record itself in its native format.
Thank you for your time and cooperation.
Sincerely, Brandon Roberts Cell: (360) 719-4930
