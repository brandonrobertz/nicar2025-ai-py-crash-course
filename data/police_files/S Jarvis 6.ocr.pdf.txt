Dear Sean:
This letter is sent to notify you that the decision has been made to terminate your employment as an officer of the Raymond Police Department. Your termination will become effective at the end of the workday today, July 3, 2018. Your final paycheck with pay through July 3, 2018, along with payment for your accrued unused leave, will be issued by city hall today.
Please understand that this decision was not one I took lightly. I considered all of the information you ptovided through your due process meeting, However, in the final, analysis, I simply cannot continue the employment of an officer who demonstrated the extreme lack of judgment and inattention to duty that you did. As I mentioned in your due process notice, it is deeply disturbing that a member of our Police Department purposely conducted numerous clandestine middle of-the might meetings with a young woman, including meetings in your patrol car that lasted for hours, while you were on duty and receiving compensation from the City. Not only did you intentionally select remote locations where you could secretly meel this young woman without detection, but you received an intimate sexual image of her breasts from her and did nothing to object to that transmittal. Instead, you admitted that you were flattered. Furthermore, all of this happened during a period when you were assigned to work in the local high school. You should have been a role model for these young people. Instead, you abused your position and engaged in behavior that is contrary to the Department's core principles and damaging to its reputation.
Given this, I cannot justify continuing your employment as a City of Raymond police officer.
