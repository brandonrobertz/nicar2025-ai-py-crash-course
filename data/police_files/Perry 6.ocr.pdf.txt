MEMORANDUM
PASCO POLICE DEPARTMENT
Field Operations Division
TO:
Chief Denis Austin
FROM:
Captain Ken Roske
SUBJECT:
Officer Dean Perry, Reprimand
DATE:
October 3, 2005
After discussions with Officer Dean Perry regarding a recent reprimand that he received he had requested that I reconsider the issuance of the Reprimand. He felt that since he had no other occurrences or discipline in his file that this was to harsh of treatment.
I met with Sergeant Monroe about the Reprimand and both of us are in agreement that the violation that took place was serious and deserved a form of discipline that would send a message to modify the officer's behavior.
Based on the information from Officer Perry and Sergeant Monroe which supports the lack of any discipline in his file, I would recommend that you allow this Reprimand to be removed from Officer Perry's personnel file one year from the date of issuance if the following has occurred;
A satisfactory evaluation from his supervisor
No like occurrences during that year
3. That Officer Perry submits a request to your office for consideration of removal.
