Notification of Disciplinary Action
Officer Rollman, the intent of this communication is to formally notify you of disciplinary action being taken regarding an internal investigation and to serve as the documentation of same.
On April 15, 2014 the Use of Force Review Board met to discuss incident #14-0683. At the completion of the review the Board recommended an internal investigation be initiated due to discrepancies between the information included in your written report and what was observed on your in-car video.
I initiated an investigation the following day and the outcome of the investigation found that you had violated the following Operating Policies:
• Policy 404.5
• Policy 464.1.1
• Policy 324.3.5(c)

Report Preparation
Performance
The investigation packet was reviewed by Chief Stines and he found that the investigation was conducted within department policy. Additionally, he concurred with the recommended discipline: a permanent letter of reprimand.
Officer Rollman, while I truly believe there was no malicious intent related to the inaccuracies in your written report, the fact of the matter is you are a veteran officer and there is no legitimate excuse for your performance. Be aware that any further violations of this manner, if founded, will be met with higher levels of discipline, up to and including termination.
