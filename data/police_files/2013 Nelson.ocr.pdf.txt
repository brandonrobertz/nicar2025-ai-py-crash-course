Written Counseling
On December 26, 2013 at 0700hrs., I was sitting down at the briefing desk about to start shift briefing when I heard you say to Officer Fairley that he had a "small penis". This was apparently was said in a joking manner at the end of a conversation you were having with him and others.
The entire shift was also sitting at the squad room table at the time you made this comment.
Upon hearing this I immediately began briefing so whatever matter you were discussing would end.
This counseling notice is to reinforce to you that such comments are inappropriate and will not be tolerated. Especially since you and others have recently received work place harassment training you should have known better than to make such a comment. After briefing I spoke with you about the matter and you told me that you "weren't thinking" when you made the comment. I would caution you that in the future to think before you speak.
You are specifically instructed that in the future you do not make inappropriate remarks to others and remember your work place harassment training. Any additional violations of this nature may result in more severe disciplinary measures.
