RE: Public Records Requests - PRR 061520B
Dear Mr. Roberts,
The City of Vader has been in receipt of your Public Records Request which was received by my office via email on June 15, 2020.
- Records of reprimands or warnings issued to officers of the Vader Police Department between January 1, 2000 and January 1, 2020
- Information being requested includes, but is not limited to:
officer name, date of reprimand/warning, type of allegation/infraction (e.g. excessive use of force, unauthorized use of equipment, etc.), finding (e.g. sustained, unfounded), and action(s) taken (e.g. written or verbal warning, suspension).
On June I responded to you requesting additional time for my response.2
We have not had our own police department since 2011. We now contract with Lewis County Sheriff's Office for coverage.
For the years 2000-2011 we no longer have these records per the State of Washington Secretary of State Local Government Common Records Retention Schedule Version 4.0 (May 2017)
Retain for 6 years after separation from agency business then destroy.
I have attached a copy of page 129 of this document for your reference.
This completes the city's response to your public records request and the file is now closed. If you would like to request additional documents, please submit a new public records request to the City.
Thanks for your patience while you were waiting on my response. If can help in any other way, please contact me at (360) 295-3222 or via email at vadercity@centurylink.net.
Sincerely,
Dianne Floyd
City Clerk/Public Records Officer
