Complaint Disposition; IA 16-06; Sergeant Hargraves
August 9, 2016
On May 25, 2016, an internal investigation was initiated after I was informed that
Records Specialist I
may have been the victim of sexual harassment by
way of a text message from Sergeant Dan Hargraves in July 2015.
Sergeant Opgenorth and Commander Tenant were assigned to conduct a full investigation into the incident to determine if Sergeant Hargraves violated Pullman Police Department (PPD or City policies. The completed investigation was reviewed by Commander Tenant who provided recommendations and then forwarded it to me for disposition.
Upon reviewing the investigation, I concluded the following:
Inappropriate text message:
â€¢ City Policy Section 2.5: Sexual Harassment Prohibited
Sustained. Sufficient evidence was presented to conclude that the text was unwelcome and meets the criteria for sexual harassment.
Sergeant Hargraves received supervisory counseling from Commander Tenant as a result of this incident. There were mitigating factors that led to a disposition of supervisory counseling rather than more severe discipline. Those factors include that the alleged activity took place once, there is no prior history of similar behavior, and that Hargraves reasonably thought the text (at the time) was mutual.
