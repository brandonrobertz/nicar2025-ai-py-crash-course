Bob Metzger, Police Chief
16-35255 - Pursuit

I have reviewed the information on this incident that occurred August 11, 2016 and involved a vehicle pursuit. I concur with the recommendations of Captain Cook and Sergeant Miller that you violated policy 41.2.2. I also concur with the recommended discipline for this infraction - that being a letter of reprimand and one day suspension, to be held in abeyance for one year from the date of this memo.
You may request a hearing with me if you wish to discuss this further. You may also take any other action that is available to you under the current CBA. If you have any questions or need further information on this please let me know.
