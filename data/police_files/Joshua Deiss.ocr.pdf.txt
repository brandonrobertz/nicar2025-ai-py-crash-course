On 08/30/2012, at 1000 hrs, we meet in my office in regards allegations of conduct unbecoming an officer. And possible illegal drug usage. Present with you was your union rep. Glenn Steffler. I advised you of the allegations and handed you a copy of the face book postings you were involved in.
RS: Cold Weed? As in a bong with an ice chamber? Shits legit!
JC: (:
Josh Deiss: I love putting ice.. in my hookay...to smoke shisha..: Just poured me a Dry Fly and Coke!
JC: It's okay I know you're a popo and everthing but we all know it's not shisha you're smoking!!!
Josh Deiss: Haha... It was akward taking that entry polygraph. Just saying.
JC: You ain't gotta lie to kick it.
JC: Bahahaha
KF: Ya'll crack me up.
Josh Deiss: Think I might go get the Hookah... Thanks for the subliminal messaging...
JC: Yeah I'll go smoke my "hookah" too....
You stated that you don't do drugs and that the posting of face book was only a joke, and you never said that you smoked pot. You then asked for a drug test. I then advised you that at this point in the investigation vou would be escorted to Coulee Community Hospital for a Urine analysis. After that was complete you would be placed on Administration leave with pay until such time the test results come back. This letter is to inform you that the test results have come back negative. At this point you are cleared to return to work on 09/01/2012 at 1900hrs. An investigation of this incident is being done by a third party (Canfield & Associates) and you will be kept informed of the progress.
