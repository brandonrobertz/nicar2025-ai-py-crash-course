Internal Investigations 15-03.15-05
Dear Officer Kim,
On October 16th, 2015 I scheduled a Loudermill Hearing for this investigation, 15-03, and you, Teamster's Business Representative Mark Manning and I met to discuss the case. After the meeting it was decided among the three of us that I would not impose discipline until such time as you decided whether you wished to stay with the City of Pacific or look for work elsewhere. You did choose to stay with the City of Pacific and I proceeded to impose discipline. On January 5th, 2016 I met with Mark Manning to discuss removing and/or editing the original Loudermill Hearing letter dated September 29, 2015.
I have rewritten the original letter and excluded parts that you and Mr. Manning have already requested and reviewed. I have attached the final draft of that letter for your review. Based on the sustained findings in the investigation I have imposed the following discipline;
1) You will receive two days suspension without pay. You are authorized to select the dates and the dates may be in two separate pay periods. I have received your message that you wish to take off February 11th, 2106 and February 161, 2016.
IA 15-05 involved damage to your patrol car driver's door. The investigation did sustain that you were the cause of the damage. You did accept responsibility for this damage and you agreed to pay to have the door repaired prior to a Loudermill Hearing. There was no Loudermill Hearing in this case. There will be no further disciplinary action taken in this case.
Sincerely yours
John f. Calkins, Chief
