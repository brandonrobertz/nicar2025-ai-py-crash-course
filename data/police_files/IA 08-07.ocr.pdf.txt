SUBJECT:
Permanent Disciplinary Letter - Internal Affairs Investigation 08-07
On April 17, 2008 you were on duty and fell asleep while operating Patrol Vehicle 1359.
Your vehicle left the roadway, struck a mailbox and came to rest after striking a rock wall. The vehicle sustained front end bumper, grill and hood damage. Fortunately, no other vehicle or persons were involved in the collision and you were not seriously injured. The results of this collision could have been far worse. Your actions were found to be a violation of MOS 13.1.1 B 2 (a) Neglect of Duty.
You stated you were overly fatigued due to an interruption in your normal sleep pattern, having not achieved a sufficient amount of sleep before reporting for duty. However, you have also stated that you understand that it is your responsibility to maintain fitness for duty and to advise your supervisor if you are unable to do so. You further stated you have taken corrective steps to insure that in the future, you do not put yourself, this department, or the public at risk due to being too fatigued to work safely. You have also offered to share your research and experience with others through role call training to help other officers avoid similar problems.
I expect you to follow through and develop and conduct roll call training on preventing shift work related fatigue. Any future fatigue related policy violation may result in more severe discipline. This letter will remain permanently in your personnel file.
