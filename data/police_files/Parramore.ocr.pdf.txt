Letter of Reprimand
Tele. 509-544-3484
Fay 509_545-3423
On May 10, 2012, you reported to me you had damaged your assigned department vehicle in a backing incident. As reported, you backed into a metal fence pole as you were leaving the parking lot of the training building at 1S and Clark. The damage to the vehicle was minor and did not require repair.
When I spoke to you about the incident, you admitted fault and did not find it necessary for the accident review board to review the incident. You also provided me with a memo in regards to the incident along with the photos of the scene and your vehicle.
I have reviewed these items along with your past record of similar incidents. I found you had a similar incident in May of 2010 in which you received counseling notice. This incident accounts for 2 vehicle backing incidents causing damage to a city vehicle within 2 years.
This letter serves as a letter of reprimand for failing to use due caution while operating a city vehicle. In damaging your assigned vehicle, you violated the Pasco Police Departments policy 26.1.1 (AAA), Code of Conduct: Members of the police department shall operate official vehicles in a careful and prudent manner and shall obey all laws and all department orders pertaining to such operation.
This reprimand will be in affect from the day of issue and will remain in effect for three (3) years. At the end of the three year period, you my request the Chief of Police to remove the letter from your department personnel file.
Future violations of this policy may result in more serious discipline, up to and including termination
