On 8/6/2007 at 0630 hours, St Majetich and I talked with Ofc. Perry in reference to his use of force during the arrest of Steven Palmer case 07-22377
I read Ofc. Perry his Reprimand and asked if he had any questions. He said he would address them during his grievance.
• I went over how he did great with the verbal part of the incident. However he should have used lethal cover because he was not sure if the suspects were armed or not.
• We went over how he should have moved closer to cover Ofc. Greenhalgh as he cuffed the first suspect. Then he would have had a better view of the suspect Palmer's hands.
• We covered how when he left the cover of his vehicle to move closer towards suspect
Palmer. That was a bad tactical move because he now had no cover and it caused Ofc.
Greenhalgh to have to draw his duty weapon to cover him. While still holding onto his suspect.
• I went over how during Less-Lethal training we teach that we need at the minimum of three officers to be safe. One for lethal, one for less-lethal and one for arrest.
• We covered how he should have stayed behind cover and waited for more officers or move to cover Ofc. Greenhalgh.
• We covered how Less-Lethal is an extension of your baton. However at no time did suspect Palmer become aggressive towards them. So during those 40 seconds of this incident Less-Lethal could not be used.
• We covered how as Police Officers we need to be able to move up and down the use of force continuum.
Ofc. Perry agreed that he could learn more tactics but he stated the officer determines the amount of force necessary during the incident because of his perception of the threat.
I think Ofc. Perry understands but will not admit it because he would have to admit what he did was wrong. Sgt. Majetich and I tried several times to get through to him. We will see what happens by his actions.
