RE: Discipline Findings
Dear Officer Wakerman,
On Wednesday, November 18, 2020, at 0900, a pre-disciplinary hearing was held regarding policying violations that were noted in the pre-disciplinary notice that you received on November 4, 2020.
Present during our hearing was Deputy Chief Cook and Officer Greenhalgh (PPOA Representative).
In that meeting, you did not dispute the facts provided in the pre-discipline hearing notice. You took full responsibility for the policy violations and acknowledged your actions were not consistent with department policy.
I have carefully considered the information you provided in the pre-discipline hearing. Because you accepted responsibility and identified changes you need to make in your work patterns (practices) to eliminate future issues, I concur with the recommendations from Captain Parramore. I do not feel the need to impose more severe discipline.
You will be placed on a one-day non-paid suspension. Captain Parramore will inform you of which day
that suspension will take place
Please know that any further policy violations may result in more severe discipline to include terminations of employment. A copy of this discipline findings letter will be placed in your personnel file located in Human Resources.
Ken Roske, Chief of Police
