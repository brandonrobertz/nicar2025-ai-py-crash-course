Dear Mr. Roberts:
On June 15, 2020, the City of Pacific received your request for public records, requesting the following documents:

1. 2020

On July 13, 2020, you revised your request to read: If reducing the time range would speed up the process, I will request to narrow my search to the past 10 years (since Jan 2010). Furthermore, I am interested onl in infractions that resulted in punishment and am particularly interested in more serious violations that led to more serious punishments like suspension, termination, strikes against their record or resulted in the officer resigning.

(33) pages of hard copy records. Payment has been received for this installment, and accordingly your records are enclosed here with.
