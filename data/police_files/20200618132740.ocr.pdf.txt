On 04/26/2019 you were driving your assigned department owned vehicle while on duty. As you were backing out of the driveway in front of 110 Miles Dr., you subsequently backed into a US Mail Truck that had just pulled up to deliver mail at that residence. The collision caused minor damage to the USPS Mail Truck and only minor marks were left on your patrol vehicle, you indicated that you had checked your mirrors prior to backing up but failed to observe the approaching mail vehicle.
Department Policy #7.03.19 City Property states: "Members shall not lose or damage City Property.
Members are required to care for the items issued to them or in their control."
Policy #27.06.03 requires that a review be completed. I have reviewed the incident and discussed this matter with you. While the totality of circumstances indicate that your vision was obstructed from clearly observing the USPS Mail Truck due to a arborvitae hedge next to the driveway, additional measures could have been taken to avoid this collision and subsequent damage to the USPS mail truck and department property. Based on this you are found to be at fault as that this was a preventable accident.
I have read and understand the above information and discussed this with my immediate supervisor.
Ofc.
I met with MPO Steve Gay on 05-03-19 and discussed with him the issue noted.
