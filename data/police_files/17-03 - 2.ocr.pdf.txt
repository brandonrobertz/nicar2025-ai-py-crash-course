RE:
JA 17-03
Sgt. Bos,
After I have reviewed the investigation, I have determined that you did violate the policies mentioned in the complete investigation that I provided to you for review. In addition to the IA, there were three subsequent issues brought to my attention by Lt. Hong. I have decided to include those issues in the IA and they will no longer be pending. Through this agreement, this entire investigation is closed.
You will receive three days of suspension without pay. One of the three days will be held in abeyance. If you successfully complete the Performance Improvement Plan that Lt. Hong will explain, and review with you, that third day will be suspended. I am satisfied that we reached an agreement that we both can agree
Lt. Hong will contact you and implement the Performance Plan. I believe that you will be successful and continue to contribute to this agency and be a very important part of the Organization.
Sincerely yours,
(
Jon T. Calkins, Chief
