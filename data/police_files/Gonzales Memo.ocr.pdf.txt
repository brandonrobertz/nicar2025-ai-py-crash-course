INTEROFFICE COMMUNICATION

Lt. Marty Fuller
FROM:
Sandra Gonzales, Property & Evidence Technician
SUBJECT: Statement of Observations in RPD Parking Garage
Reference: Case 18-004808
DATE:
September 13, 2018
On Tuesday, September 5, 2018, between the hours of 0930 a.m. and 1000 a.m., Property & Evidence Technician, Jackie Naroski and I went down to the Redmond PD (RPD) parking garage to review the vehicle pens to determine if more vehicles needed to be inventoried.
As we approached vehicle pen #2 from the east, we noticed that the gate to vehicle pen #2 was not properly closed. (I observed that the officer's original red zip tie attached to the gate was still intact). The right side of the gate (where the zip tie was attached) was in its corrected position, however, the left side of the gate was slightly pulled apart, approximately 3 to 5 inches.
I commented to Jackie how this was a strange way to secure a vehicle pen. I then took three (3) red zip ties and attached them to each other to secure the gate above the officer's zip tie to pen #2 without moving the position of the gate as I had observed it and in keeping the original officer's zip tie intact.
The above-statement is accurate to the best of my recollection.
End of statement.
