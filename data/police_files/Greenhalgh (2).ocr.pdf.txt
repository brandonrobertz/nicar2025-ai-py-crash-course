Det. Greenhalgh Backing Accident
On January 24tt, Detective Greenhalgh backs his assigned vehicle into the trailer ball of a pick-up truck which was parked at SARC parking lot.
This happen as he was trying to maneuver out of
the parking lot.
There was no damage to the other vehicle and minimal damage to the department's vehicle. The vehicle will not be sent to be repaired.
Detective Greenhalgh is not requesting a review board for his backing accident and he recognizes the incident to be his fault. He has no known vehicle accidents related to his employment. I would recommend that the verbal counseling that he received from his Sergeant conclude this accident.
