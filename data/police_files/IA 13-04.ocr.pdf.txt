Re: Disposition of IA 13-04.
Dear Ms. Fogg:
I am writing to advise you of the conclusion of my review of your "Citizen's Complaint" against Chief Gibson. This complaint challenged Chief Gibson's decision to move forward with investigation of your potential violation of a gag order. This is designated as IA 13-02. Your basic contention was that it was inappropriate or unlawful for Chief Gibson to move forward with and/or continue the investigation given that you were no longer employed by the City as a commissioned law enforcement officer. I have concluded my review of this contention. In my judgment, it is not well-founded. The investigation related to your alleged conduct while still employed by the City and while still under Chief Gibson's direction. It did not involve review of your activities as a private citizen following the termination of your employment. The decision to investigate appears to have been a reasonable exercise of Chief Gibson's discretion, and not in violation of any policy or procedure. I also have consulted with the City's legal counsel and am advised the investigation is not in violation of law. Our review of your Citizen's Complaint against Chief Gibson is closed.
Sincerely,
Mayor John Marchione
