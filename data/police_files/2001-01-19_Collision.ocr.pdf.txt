Memo
To:
Officer Kelly Clark
From: H.M. Vandiver, Chief of Police CC:
Date: January 19, 2001
Re;
Formal Letter of Reprimand
The Accident Review Board convened on January 15, 2001 to review your accident of November 17,
2000. They concluded the accident was avoidable and recommended a formal letter of reprimand. I concur with their recommendation.
This memo constitutes the formal letter of reprimand. It is issued for the following reasons:
On November 17, 2000 at approximately 0749 hours, you were travelling northbound on Highway 101 in Shelton, on-duty, in a Tumwater Police Department patrol vehicle. There were patches of ice throughout the area. You were in the process of accelerating to pass a vehicle that moved into the right lane when you lost control of the police vehicle. Your vehicle crossed into the southbound lanes, struck the overpass Jersey barrier, rotated in a clockwise direction and crossed back into the northbound lanes where it struck the guardrail on the East Side of the road. The damage to the car was considerable and it was deemed a total loss.
The weather and driving conditions you encountered provided ample warning that additional care and caution were required. You failed to adjust and alter your driving and vehicle speed in clearly deteriorating driving conditions. You needlessly placed yourself and other motorists in danger. First, by following too closely to the vehicle in front of you, and second, by ignoring potential hazards and attempting to pass a vehicle.
Your vehicle speed was a significant contributing factor to this accident. Your speed at the time of the accident was 60 - 65 miles per hour. Additionally, eyewitnesses said you passed them earlier at an estimated 70 - 75 miles per hour. Operating your vehicle in this manner is against department policy and is not justified.
