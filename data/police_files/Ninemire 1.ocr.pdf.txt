VERBAL REPRIMAND
On 7-15-2019 I received a printed copy of an email sent to Peggy Dvorak from
Kevin Baird (WSP) expressing his concern that your behavior during the
ACCESS class was inappropriate. The email included a letter written to Kevin from your ACCESS instructor, Bill McAllister, detailing your conduct during the class.
There were several concerns from Bill and Kevin, to include the following:
1. You "appeared agitated just having to be there"
2. You failed to answer what Kevin thought were simple questions.
3. You commented "guess I'm going to have to get my union rep involved in this"
4. You refused instructional materials both times they were offered to you.
Your conduct is in violation of Policy 26.1.1 Code of Conduct
General Conduct
Unbecoming Conduct: Employees of the Police Department shall conduct themselves at all times, both on and off duty, in a manner that does not reflect negatively on the Department. Employee conduct, which brings discredit on the
Department, may subject the employee to discipline.
Further violations of this policy could lead to additional discipline up to and
including termination.
A copy of this Letter of Reprimand will be kept in your personnel file, and this incident will be referred to on your next annual evaluation.
I acknowledge receipt of a copy of this Letter of Reprimand.
