Date: 6/24/2018
Date of incident: 6/22/2018 Time: 1515 Location: E/B Hwy 16 between the first and second Gig Harbor exit
Completed by Sgt. Glantz#710
Summary of Incident: I spoke with Ms. Kutzke on 6/24/18. She was driving E/B on Hwy 16 in the right lane of travel, her cruise control set between 60-61 MPH. She noticed a vehicle pass her on the left and it was speeding. She saw the white lettering on the side of the car of Port Orchard Police. She estimated the speed of the police car to be around 70 MPH and said something like, "It was going like a bat out of hell. The police officer should be setting an example for others". She took the second Gig Harbor exit and lost sight of the police car which continued in its same lane of travel. She said the vehicle didn't have any lights or sirens on and other drivers followed behind the police car going the same speed. She said the police car wasn't following anyone and there weren't any vehicles in front of the car.

Disposition/Comments:I spoke with Officer Walton about the complaint. She admitted it was her driving and she had set the cruise control to 70 MPH. She wasn't going to call, but driving home from work. I told her to make sure she's going the speed limit to avoid any future complaints, unless she's responding to an emergency call utilizing emergency lights and sirens.
I find Officer Walton violated POPD G.O. 2030.II.E.1. See Attached O Date Citizen re-contacted: 1/1/2010 by:
