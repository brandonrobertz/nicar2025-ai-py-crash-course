Re:
Officer Involved Motor Vehicle Accident
Officer Elliott, the intent of this communication is to inform you of the results from the accident review board held on Aril 15, 2008 regarding an accident you were involved in On March 5, 2008
The accident review board examined the reports and other information provided. The board determined that the accident was:
The accident was found to be avoidable. It was determined that you were not driving with due caution and diligence which was the major contributing factor to the collision.
The accident review board recommended a permanent letter of reprimand be placed in your file and your take home vehicle privileges be suspended for 60 days. In addition, you are to complete a four hour remedial driving course, independent of the standard EVOC training. I concur with the board's recommendation. The suspension of the take home vehicle privileges will begin May 1, 2008.
Officer Elliott, I am concerned that you are establishing a pattern of vehicle accidents which are attributable to a lack of attention on your part. In the last three accidents you have been involved in you were distracted by something, whether it was another vehicle or dropping something on the floor of the vehicle you were operating. It is imperative that you consider the safe operation of your patrol vehicle as your primary concern when in the performance of your duties. You are operating a device far more powerful and destructive than any of the weapons in our inventory; you must place the public's safety above all else. If this pattern continues it may place your status with the agency in doubt as the city's insurance carrier may refuse you coverage.
You are hereby notified that further incidents of this nature can result in increasing levels of discipline, up to and including termination.
ChietStines
Officer Dale Elliott
Signing above indicates your receipt of this reprimand.
