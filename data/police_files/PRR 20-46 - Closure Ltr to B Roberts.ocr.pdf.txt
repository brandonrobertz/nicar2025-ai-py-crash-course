RE: Your Public Records Request - PRR 20-46
Dear Mr. Roberts:
The City of Ruston was in receipt of your Public Records Request, which was received by my office, via email, on June 15, 2020.
This request was assigned file number PR 20-46 and acknowledged by the City in a letter dated June 19
2020. At that time, we estimated it would take sixty-five (65) days gather the records for your review and that I would have records available by August 24, 2020. On August 24, 2020 the City requested additional time and would have responsive records available by September 7, 2020 (which was a holiday).
You requested to receive copies of these records via email, in a machine-readable format (Excel/Word documents, text files, database dump, PDF, etc.). If the records exist in electronic form, you request that we do not create a new record (e.g. by printing the electronic record and then scanning it) but provide the electronic record itself in its native format for the following:
• Records of reprimands or warnings issued to officers of the Ruston Police Department between
January 1, 2000 and January 1, 2020
• Information being requested includes, but is not limited to officer name, date of reprimand/warning, type of allegation/infraction (e.g. excessive use of force, unauthorized use of equipment, etc.), finding (e.g. sustained, unfounded), and actions) taken (e.g. written or verbal
warning, suspension)
City's Response: The City found responsive records and notified you on September 8, 2020 that these records consisted of a total of forty-eight (48) pages. The City is in receipt of $4.80 for reimbursement for these electronic records.
Attached to the City's email response to you, dated
September 14, 2020,
openredords.broberts@gmail.com are the responsive documents.
This now closes Public Records Request - PRR 20-46.
Sincerely,
CITY OF RUSTON
Judy Grams
City Clerk
Cc: Bruce Hopkins, Mayor
