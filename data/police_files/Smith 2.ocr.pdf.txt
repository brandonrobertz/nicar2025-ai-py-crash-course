Detective Smith Collision
OFFICES
200
On July 24, 2018, at approximately 1100 hours, I met with Detective Smith reference his on-duty collision on Columbia River Road in Franklin County. I forwarded a memorandum to Captain Cook with my recommendations for the specific type of discipline Detective Smith should receive. Captain Cook agreed with me and it was determined that Detective Smith should receive a verbal warning, and that verbal warning will be reflected on his end of year annual employee evaluation.
I met with Detective Smith at the Police Department and reviewed the importance of safe driving. I informed Detective Smith that this collision would be reflected on his annual employee evaluation.
