Pre-Disciplinary Hearing Disposition; IA 14-05
July 22, 2014
On May 25, 2014, an investigation of possible policy violation(s) leading up to and including a motor vehicle accident on May 25, 2014, was commenced. On July 3, 2014, I notified you of my intent to discipline with a written reprimand. On July 17, 2014, I held a pre-disciplinary hearing to give you the opportunity to provide additional evidence or mitigating circumstances related to the investigation as it pertains to the intended discipline. The Pullman Police Officers' Guild attorney, Anil Karia, was on speakerphone as your representative per your request.
As a result of the information presented during the pre-disciplinary hearing, I have amended the intended discipline to a verbal warning for violation of Pullman Police Department Policy, Chapter 9, Section 2.2:
Driver Responsibility
Members shall operate vehicles in a safe and skillful manner consistent with the prevailing road conditions. Members shall not abuse vehicles or vehicle equipment. Vehicles shall be operated consistent with applicable traffic laws and department policies, directives and training.
I will instruct Commander Tenant to cause a verbal warning be issued to you.
Please let me know if you have any questions.
