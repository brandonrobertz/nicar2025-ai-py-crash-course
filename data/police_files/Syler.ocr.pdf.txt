Appreciate K9-30

Andy,
Just want to say I really appreciated Jim and Rock taking time to attend an event last night in the PD training room. It was a dinner coordinated by the Lakewood Knights Lions Club, to provide for in need families. The members of the Club prepared dinner and had a number of wrapped packages for the families. The coordinator of the event specifically requested if possible a K-9. Unit atterid
Jim and Rock (probably mostly Rock ©) were a big hit with the kids, and I know the coordinator appreciated it as well. Solid work Jim and Rock!

Chief Zaro,
I'm sure the Spay and Neuter Clinic lets you know how much they appreciate Officer Skyler for his volunteering to provide security every ear at their dinner and auction. I'd like to also say how fantastic it is that he is giving back to the communityon his own time to let them put the money they otherwise would have to pay.
