Notification of Disciplinary Action
Officer Hedin-Baughn, the intent of this communication is to formally notify you of disciplinary action being taken regarding your handling of two collision investigations and a Notice of Infraction.
On June 14, 2016 an internal investigation was initiated after discovering an incomplete collision report and a Notice of Infraction from May 2016. The internal investigation also revealed a second incomplete collision report from May 2016. The results of the internal investigation found you were in violation of Department Policy 324 - Conduct.
My review memo was submitted to Chief Stines on July 25, 2016, who concurred with the recommended discipline: a permanent letter of reprimand.
Officer Hedin-Baughn, while I appreciate the responsibility you have always taken for your mistakes, the fact of the matter is we have been dealing with your inability to handle tasks in a timely manner off and on for the past 7-8 years. You have attended time management training, been open to suggestions from supervisors and co-workers, and sought external help on your own. However, none of the efforts appear to have any long lasting effect. Be aware that any further violations of this manner, if founded, will be met with punitive discipline, up to and including termination.
