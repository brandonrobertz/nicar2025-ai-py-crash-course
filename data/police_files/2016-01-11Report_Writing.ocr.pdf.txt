Notification of Disciplinary Action
Officer Hedin-Baughn, the intent of this communication is to formally notify you of disciplinary action being taken regarding your handling of investigations.
On December 7, 2015 an internal investigation was initiated as the result of a complaint from a citizen about the status of a 2014 incident where he was a victim of fraud. This complaint led to the discovery of 4 incomplete investigation reports (3 from 2014 and one from 2015) that were assigned to you. The results of the internal investigation found you were in violation of Department Policy 464 - Report Writing and Policy 324 - Conduct.
My review memo was submitted to Chief Stines on January 11, 2016, who concurred with the recommended discipline: a 5-year letter of reprimand.
Officer Hedin-Baughn, while I appreciate that you have taken responsibility and are remorseful for your mistake, the fact of the matter is your actions brought embarrassment on this department and there is a troubling pattern developing with you in regard to handling tasks in a timely manner. Be aware that any further violations of this manner, if founded, will be met with higher levels of discipline, up to and including termination 1/19l16@1530
