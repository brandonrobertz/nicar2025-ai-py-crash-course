Thanks to Sgt. Chastain, there are now gold folders in the OIC office for your active case files. The blue team still has theirs.
I want to make something very clear, all active case files are to be kept in these folders from all patrol officers. Nothing else except active case files are to be kept in them. You will not keep active case files in any other location without extenuating circumstances and my permission(or an OIC in my absence).
I found active case files in file cabinets today. I am giving you a grace period of the next eight days to clean up your file cabinets and any where else that you may have files. Put them in the gold and blue folders In the OIC office and no where else.
I want the OIC's to be able to find any active case file at anytime. Consider this a verbal warning for anyone that has not been following this rule. Any further problems will lead to more substantial consequences.
