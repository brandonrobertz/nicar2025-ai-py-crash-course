I.A.S.U. NO. 06-02
To:
Officer Jay Sheehan
From: Chief Steven R. Harris
Subject: Internal Investigation 2006-02
Date: March 23, 2006
On March 22, 2006 a pre-disciplinary hearing was held to discuss the finding of internal investigation no. 2006-02. At that hearing you offered candid information regarding your behavior on the night of January 24, 2006.
After careful consideration of the investigative conclusions and your comments yesterday
I have decided on the following discipline for you:
Three weeks (12 work days or 120 hours) suspension without pay.
• No off duty employment until further notice.
• No department overtime unless required by emergency and pre-authorized by a member of your chain of command.
• A performance action plan will be prepared by your Lieutenant and Commander prior to your return to work. Strict adherence to the plan is mandatory.
Satisfactory completion of all remedial training identified as necessary.
The suspension without pay will begin on March 27, 2006.
Should subsequent criminal court or Department of Licensing proceedings render you incapable of fulfilling your duties as a Redmond Police Officer I will have to consider further discipline in this matter.
You are strongly encouraged to seek professional assistance in coping with the issues we discussed on March 22, 2006.
Steven R. Harris
