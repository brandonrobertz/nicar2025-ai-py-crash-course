12/06/19
Complainant: Tracey Norton
Officer: Saul Duran
I have reviewed this complaint and found that Officer Duran acted within Department policy during this incident. However; I did discuss with him that it was not good judgement for him to recontact Norton at the Betina's beauty solon after he had completed his initial contact. Officer Duran agreed with that assessment and said he knew immediately after he did that, the complaint would most likely follow.
I noted Officer Duran did call me immediately after the contact occurred that evening and advised me of the incident. He was completely forthcoming and advised me of all the facts, to include the less favorable ones regarding his actions.
While discussing this incident, in person, with Officer Duran on 12/5/19, I advised him of my findings and that he was within policy with the exception of his subsequent interactions with Ms. Norton at the Betina's salon. I advised him this inquiry would be closed with a verbal counseling.
Ms. Norton was advised of the inquiry process and my findings via email.
Chief LaLiberte
