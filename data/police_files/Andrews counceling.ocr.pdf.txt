COUNSELINg NOTICE
PASCO POLICE DEPARTMENT
FIELD OPERATIONS DIVISION
TO:
Officer Andrews
FROM:
Sergeant Gregory
SUBJECT:
Vehicle Accident, Counseling Notice
DATE:
July 1, 2018
Facts:
On June 25, 2019, you were patrolling in the area of south 9th Avenue and River Road. At the top of an incline, you decided to make a U-turn in an area where the roadway was wider. As you made your U-turn, you struck a bike path pole that prevents vehicles from going on the path. Although the pole was painted gray, it is still something you should have avoided
Policy:
CALLS
41.2.1.B. RESPONSE TO EMERGENCY, URGENT, AND NON-EMERGENCY
B. Responsibilities of On-Duty Driving
When officers are not responding to urgent or emergency calls, they are expected to drive in a safe manner and operate the vehicle in compliance with the RCWs.
Nothing in this section is meant to reduce officer's responsibilities as outlined in CW 46.61.035
"Authorized Emergency Vehicles".
Response:
Counseling Notice
I reviewed the memo as well as investigating the incident first hand. The pole is painted gray however; you should have seen it while making your U-turn. However, you quickly took responsibility for your mistake.
Because you have not had any other collision this collision will result in a counseling notice.
Please understand that further collisions involving the damage of property or violations of this policy may result in more severe consequences
