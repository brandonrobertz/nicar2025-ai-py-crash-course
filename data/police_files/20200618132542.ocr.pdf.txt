Verbal Reprimand
Set. Quantrell, on 01/01/2015 you were driving a department owned vehicle while at the scene of a call and backed that vehicle into another department owned patrol vehicle, resulting in damage to both vehicles.
Department Policy #7.03.19 City Property states: "Members shall not lose or damage City Property.
Members are required to care for the items issued to them or in their control."
Policy #27.06.03 requires that a review be completed. I have reviewed your accident report and discussed this matter with you. Based on both your report and interview, it is clear that you are at fault and that this
was a preventable accident.
You are issued a verbal reprimand for your failure to take proper care of city property/equipment in violation of Policy #7.03.19. This verbal reprimand will remain in your personal file for a minimum of one (1) year, when you may request that it be removed.
I have been advised of this disciplinary action and have received a copy. I have been ordered to sign this notice and understand that failure or refusal to sign will result in additional disciplinary action. I have the right to attach a written statement to this notice in my personnel file, if I so choose.
