Counseling Notice
On 1/24/2012 you were preparing to respond to a theft in progress call and while backing from the compound gate keypad, the left front fender of your patrol vehicle (184) struck the key pad post causing damage to the vehicle fender. Damage was limited to the front fender but serious enough that it required repairs at the body shop.
Pursuant to department policy all members must drive in a safe manner to avoid damage to department equipment. Although you have no history (past five years) of damaging police vehicles this notice is a reminder to use caution when backing.
