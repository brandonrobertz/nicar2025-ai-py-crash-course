NOTICE OF RETURN TO WORK

October 21st, 2019
Officer Chuck Schandel
SUBJECT: Notice of Return to Work
BY:
Matt Brown, Chief of Police
Effective October 21st, you have been returned to duty from paid administrative leave. A prosecutorial review of the alleged criminal case has been completed with a declination to charge. However, the administrative review of alleged policy violations remains ongoing.
You will return to your regular duty schedule on October 23rd, 2019, at 0700 hrs.
You remain under order not to discuss this investigation with other members of the police department, except for a Port Orchard Police Guild representative and/or attorney, who is not a party to the investigation. If your chosen representative is anyone other than an attorney, you must identify that person to me to ensure the selected representative is not a party to the investigation. Discussing this event with other employees or witnesses can seriously undermine the efficient fulfillment of the Department's responsibility to investigate this matter and serves no public interest. Failure to obey this order may result in discipline.
Prior to any additional administrative interviews, you will be provided all rights granted to you as outlined in the Agreement between the Port Orchard Police Guild and the City of Port Orchard. If you have any departmental questions regarding this investigation, you are to contact Deputy Chief Schuster or me directly.
I acknowledge receipt of this notice:
