On November 8, 2011 an internal investigation was initiated due to your involvement in four preventable collisions since March, 2011. On November 29, 2011, a Loudermill Hearing took place and I listened to the information you presented. After review of the investigation and careful consideration of the facts, I have concluded your actions violated:

The three days held in abeyance and any appropriate, additional discipline up to and including termination will be imposed if you are involved in another preventable collision within the above noted eighteen month timeframe.
