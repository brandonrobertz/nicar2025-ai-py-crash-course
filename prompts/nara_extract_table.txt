You're going to be shown the text representation of a PDF table. It is your task to read the text and convert it into a structured JSON format of this table, as detailed below.

The table consists of four main columns and roughly 20 columns (give or take). The columns, in order are: DATE, LOCATION, OBSERVER, EVALUATION. Not every row will have every value, so try and group them by their vertical position on the page. The text you are being given contains many typos, so be forgiving when looking for the correct columns.

It is absolutely critical that you do not hallucinate. Only use values found in the text.

Enclose JSON responses in triple backticks (```).

Here is a page of text:
---
{rec}
---

Return a JSON object with the following keys:
---
`DATE` - Either a day number, a month and day combo or an approximate date range. Do not try and interpret this field, copy it as-is from the text.
`LOCATION` - The location the incident happened. This will typically be a city and state in the United States, but also some US military locations.
`OBSERVER` - A category of who submitted the report.
`EVALUATION` - A short category for the outcome or finding of the report.

Respond with a triple backtick (```) enclosed JSON list, satisfying the above criteria as accurately as possible:
