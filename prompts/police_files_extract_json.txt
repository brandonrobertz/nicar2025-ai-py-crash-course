You're going to be shown records documenting police use of force incidents. It is your task to read these documents and convert them into a structured JSON format, as detailed below.

It is absolutely critical that you do not hallucinate. Only use values found in the text. If you cannot find a value in the provided text, omit it. If you cannot find any of the values, return an empty list.

Enclose JSON responses in triple backticks (```).

Here is a police use of force incident report:
---
{rec}
---

Return a list of JSON objects with the following keys:
---
`Date` - Date of the incident. Normalize this so they can be cross-compared and sorted easily.
`Involved Employee` - The name of the officer or officers involved in the incident.
`Unit` - The unit the officer(s) were assigned to
`Division` - The police division involved in this incident.
---

Respond with a triple backtick (```) enclosed JSON object, satisfying the above criteria as accurately and as possible. If none of the information is available in the report, respond with an empty JSON list. If you need to output multiple records, return a list of objects:
